what are the minimal changes required (maybe introduction or more usage of metadata) to make complete flow of data (information) to alerting module and to notification module. I know alerting module is raising alertevent different from  notification module which is listening to AlertRaisedEvent. And the data recieved at alertevent handler is not even sufficient enough to persist to TrackerAlert table. I am also considering listening to alert event raised on the engine with AlertCreationEventHandler, persit then publish AlertRaisedEvent so it can have trackerAlertId from the persisted data, then notification module can be linked to trackeralert (not aggresively, maybe through params/properties/etc). recommend best practice and correct flow.
